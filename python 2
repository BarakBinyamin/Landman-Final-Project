#By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, 
#find the sum of the even-valued terms.

#declare variables
#make a temporary_term1 and set its value to 1

#make a temporary_term2 and set its value to 1

#make a temporary_term3 and set its value to 1

#make a running_sum and set its value to 0


#make a user input with the question "Find the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence up to?"


#make a loop with the conditions tmep term is less than n
    
    #set temporary_term3 equal to the sume of temporary terms 1 and 2
                    # Fibonacci sequence formula - Term_n=term(number-2) + term(number-1)
    #set temporary_term1 equal to temporary term 2
                    #set temporary term one to the value of term two
    #set temporary_term2 equal to temporary term 3
                    #set temporary term two to the value of term three
    #make an if statement with the conditions temporary_term2 is even
   
        #add the temporary term 3 to the running sum 
                    #add current term to running sum
#make a statement that prints the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence up to n
