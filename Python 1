#This is skeleton code for Euler Problem one in python
#project Euler problems can be found at https://projecteuler.net/archives

#question #1 ######## multiples of three and five ##########
#this prints multiples of three and five in order up to n
#the problem is find the sum of the multiples of three and five up to n 

# #state your variables # #
#make a three_total variable and set it to an initial value of 3

#make a five_total variable and set it to an initial value of 5

#make a running_sum variable and set it to an initial value of 0

#make a last_added variable and set it to an initial value of 0
#the last_added varable is added to avoid double counted nmultiples 


#make a user input with the question "Multiples of 3 and 5 up to?"


#make a loop that  prints the multiple of three and five in order,while simultaniously adding the multiples to a running sum it also makes sure the numbers are printed
#make a while loop with the conditions three_total and five_total less than or equal to n 

  #make an if statement with the conditions three_total less than or equal to five_total

      #make an if statement with the conditions last_added not equal to three_total

      #make a print stament for three_total 

        #add three_total to runnin_sum

        #set last added equal to three_total

      #add three to three_total

  #make an else statement
  else:
    #make an if statement with the conditions last_added not equal to five_total

      #make a print stament for five_total

      #add five_total to runnin_sum

      #set last added equal to five_total

    #add five to five_total


#make a print statement to print the sum
