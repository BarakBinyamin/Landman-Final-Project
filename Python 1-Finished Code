#question #1 ######## multiples of three and five ##########
#this prints multiples of three and five in order up to n
#the problem is find the sum of the multiples of three and five up to n 

# #state your variables # #
#make a three_total variable and set it to an initial value of 3
three_total= 3
#make a five_total variable and set it to an initial value of 5
five_total= 5
#make a running_sum variable and set it to an initial value of 0
r_s=0 #running sum 
#make a last_added variable and set it to an initial value of 0
#the last_added varable is added to avoid double counted nmultiples 
last_added=0

#make a user input with the question "Multiples of 3 and 5 up to?"
n= input("Multiples of 3 and 5 up to? ")

#make a loop that  prints the multiple of three and five in order,while simultaniously adding the multiples to a running sum it also makes sure the numbers are printed
#make a while loop with the conditions three_total and five_total less than or equal to n 
while three_total <= n and five_total <= n : #makes sure smallest number printed first
  #make an if statement with the conditions three_total less than or equal to five_total
  if three_total<= five_total:
      #make an if statement with the conditions last_added not equal to three_total
      if last_added != three_total: # makes sure double counting doesn't happen
      #make a print stament for three_total 
        print three_total
        #add three_total to runnin_sum
        r_s += three_total 
        #set last added equal to three_total
        last_added = three_total 
      #add three to three_total
      three_total += 3
  #make an else statement
  else:
    #make an if statement with the conditions last_added not equal to five_total
    if last_added != five_total:
      #make a print stament for five_total
      print five_total
      #add five_total to runnin_sum
      r_s += five_total
      #set last added equal to five_total
      last_added = five_total
    #add five to five_total
    five_total += 5

#make a print statement to print the sum 
print "the sum = " + str(r_s)
